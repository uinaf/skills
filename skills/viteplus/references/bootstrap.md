# Bootstrap

Use this reference when starting a new repo on VitePlus or converting an existing one.

## New Repo

1. Use `vp create` to scaffold the closest stock shape.
2. Keep package manager and workspace settings consistent with the repo standard.
3. Prefer `vp check`, `vp test`, and `vp build` or `vp pack` from day one.

## Existing Repo

1. Audit current scripts, CI, test imports, package manager, and packaging flow before migrating.
2. Use `vp migrate` as the default starting point instead of a hand-rolled conversion.
3. If Vite+ is already installed, inspect its packaged `AGENTS.md` first. Common locations are `node_modules/vite-plus/AGENTS.md` or the local CLI package path.
4. Reconcile generated files with the repo's real guardrails and release flow instead of assuming stock output is final.
5. Keep useful generated agent guidance, but merge it into the repo's real `AGENTS.md` instead of accepting generic VitePlus boilerplate unchanged.

## Notes

- VitePlus detects the package manager from the workspace, including `packageManager`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and lockfiles.
- Prefer a single coherent migration over partial adoption that leaves scripts, imports, and CI out of sync.
- Validate migrations with `vp env`, `vp install`, `vp check`, `vp test`, and then `vp build` or `vp pack` as appropriate.
