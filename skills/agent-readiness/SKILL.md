description: "Audit and build the infrastructure a repo needs so agents can work autonomously — boot scripts, smoke tests, CI/CD gates, dev environment setup, observability, and isolation. Use when a repo can't boot, tests are broken or missing, there's no dev environment, agents can't verify their work, or agents need human help to get anything done. Do not use for reviewing an existing diff or for documentation-only cleanup."

# Agent-Readiness

Make a repo ready for autonomous agent work by adding mechanical proof: boot scripts, smoke checks, CI/hooks, observable signals, and isolation where needed. Add the smallest useful layer first; stop once the repo is reliably verifiable.

## Boundaries

- Existing code, diff, branch, or PR review → `review`
- Your own completed product change → `verify`
- AGENTS.md, README.md, specs, or repo docs → `docs`
- Mock-only tests, docs-only cleanup, and builder self-evaluation are not readiness proof.

## The 7-Layer Stack

1. **Boot** — single command starts the app
2. **Smoke** — a fast proof the app is alive
3. **Interact** — agent can exercise the real surface
4. **E2e** — key user flows work end to end
5. **Enforce** — hooks, CI gates, lint rules, or mechanical checks
6. **Observe** — logs, health endpoints, traces, machine-readable signals
7. **Isolate** — worktrees or containers do not collide

Concrete examples:

- Boot: `pnpm dev`, `cargo run`, or `docker compose up`
- Smoke: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/health`
- Interact/E2e: `pnpm exec playwright test`
- Observe: structured logs or a machine-readable health endpoint

## Workflow

### 1. Audit

Grade the repo across these dimensions:

- **bootable**
- **testable**
- **observable**
- **verifiable**

For each, report:

- status: `pass` / `partial` / `fail`
- evidence: file, check outcome, or runtime surface
- gap: what is missing

Use [references/grading.md](references/grading.md). Lowest dimension sets the overall grade.

Example output:

```text
bootable: partial — `pnpm dev` starts the app after manual env setup
testable: fail — only mocked tests under test/
observable: partial — health endpoint exists, structured logs missing
verifiable: fail — no stable smoke or interaction script
overall grade: D
```

### 2. Setup

Build missing layers in this order:

**Boot → Smoke → Interact → E2e → Enforce → Observe → Isolate**

Each step should be independently useful. Stop once the repo is reliably verifiable.

When readiness work includes agent entrypoints, keep `AGENTS.md` as the canonical authored guide and place `CLAUDE.md` beside it as a symlink to `AGENTS.md` rather than maintaining two separate guidance files.

**Boot** — create a single-command entry point:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
<your-boot-command> &
APP_PID=$!
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
  sleep 1
done
curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/health > /dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "ERROR: App failed to start"; kill $APP_PID 2>/dev/null; exit 1
}
echo "App is ready"
```

**Smoke** — fast proof the app is alive (< 5 seconds):

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:3000/health | jq .   # HTTP service
./dist/my-cli --version                         # CLI tool
npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts               # UI app
```

**Enforce** — pre-push hook to catch failures before CI:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .git-hooks/pre-push
set -euo pipefail
<your-lint-command>
<your-smoke-command>
```

See [references/setup-patterns.md](references/setup-patterns.md) for e2e, observability, isolation, and containerized stack patterns.

### 3. Improve

Tighten weak or flaky layers:

- remove mock-only confidence theater
- replace one-off checks with reusable scripts or hooks
- add dead-code or unused-symbol enforcement where the stack supports it
- add logs and health signals agents can query
- make parallel work safe when agent collisions are real

### 4. Hand Off

When the repo reaches C+ and can be judged honestly, hand off to `verify` or `review`.
If changes created doc drift, hand off to `docs`.

## Output

After readiness work, report in this compact bullet shape:

- `- grade:` before → after
- `- evidence:` concise explanations of what readiness checks proved
- `- files changed:` changed readiness files
- `- remaining gaps:` highest-impact gaps only, or `none`
- `- next:` `verify`, `review`, `docs`, or human review

Keep details compact:

- Put dimension-by-dimension evidence in the audit table when useful, not again in the footer
- Do not paste logs; name the command or file that proves the claim
- Keep the footer to 5 labeled lines or fewer
- Omit unchanged dimensions unless they explain the final grade
- Summarize passing checks by intent and result; include full commands only when they failed, are needed for reproduction, or the user asks for them
