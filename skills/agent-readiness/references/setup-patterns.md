## Boot Scripts

Every project needs a single command to start. The tool doesn't matter — consistency does.

### Init Script

Boot the app and confirm it's alive. Run at the start of every agent session.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/init.sh
set -euo pipefail
<your-boot-command> &
APP_PID=$!
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
  sleep 1
done
curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/health > /dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "ERROR: App failed to start"; kill $APP_PID 2>/dev/null; exit 1
}
echo "App is ready"
```

## Containerized Stacks

For services with dependencies (DB, Redis, queues), use Docker Compose with health checks:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports: ["${PORT:-3000}:3000"]
    depends_on:
      db: { condition: service_healthy }
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

Boot: `docker compose up -d --wait`

## Smoke Tests

Fast (< 5 seconds) check that the app is alive. Not user flows — just "did it start."

```bash
# HTTP service
curl -sf http://localhost:3000/health | jq .

# CLI tool
./dist/my-cli --version

# UI app (Playwright)
npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts
```

## E2e Tests

Key user flows on the real running app.

- **UI**: `npx playwright test e2e/`
- **API**: Create → Read → Delete round-trips with curl/httpie
- **CLI**: Golden file diffs (`diff output.json expected.json`)
- **SDK/Library**: Build, then use the artifact as a downstream consumer would

## Mechanical Enforcement

### Git Hooks

```bash
# .git-hooks/pre-push
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
<your-lint-command>
<your-smoke-command>
```

Wire: `git config core.hooksPath .git-hooks`

### CI Gate

Smoke + integration on every PR:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/verify.yml
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: <your-boot-command>
      - run: <your-smoke-command>
      - run: <your-test-command>
```

### Custom Lint Rules

Error messages should tell the agent how to fix the issue:

```javascript
meta: {
  messages: {
    noDirectFetch: 'Use the API client from lib/api instead of fetch(). See docs/api-conventions.md'
  }
}
```

## Observability

Structured JSON logs + machine-readable health endpoints. This is what makes "Grade B" possible — agents can query results, not just read code.

```bash
# Structured log line
{"level":"info","ts":"...","msg":"request","method":"GET","path":"/api/items","status":200,"duration_ms":12}

# Health endpoint
GET /health → {"status":"ok","version":"1.2.3","uptime":3600}
```

Datadog's insight: observability isn't just for production. Wire it into the dev environment so agents can verify behavior through telemetry, not just test assertions.

## Seed Data / Fixtures

Reproducible test state prevents non-deterministic failures:

```bash
# scripts/seed.sh
<your-db-reset-command>
<your-seed-command>
```

Keep fixtures in `fixtures/` or `test/fixtures/` — version with the repo.

## Per-Worktree Isolation

For parallel agents on the same repo:

```bash
git worktree add ../feature-xyz -b feature-xyz origin/main
export PORT=$((3000 + $(echo "$PWD" | cksum | cut -d' ' -f1) % 1000))
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="app-$(basename $PWD)"
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Rules: no hardcoded ports, each worktree gets its own Docker Compose project, tear down after completion.

## Deterministic vs Agentic Split

**Always deterministic** (hardcoded, no LLM): linting, formatting, branch creation, push, PR template, test runner invocation, Docker startup.

**Agentic** (LLM decides): understanding the task, implementation, fixing failures, deciding which files to change.

This split saves tokens, reduces errors, and guarantees critical steps happen every time.

## Stop Hooks / Back-Pressure

Run targeted checks when the agent finishes a task — before commit, not just in CI. Silent on success, error-only on failure to avoid context flooding.

```bash
# .git-hooks/pre-commit or agent stop hook
set -euo pipefail
<your-typecheck-command> >/dev/null 2>&1 || <your-typecheck-command> 2>&1 | tail -20
<your-targeted-test-command> >/dev/null 2>&1 || <your-targeted-test-command> 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Pattern: run silently, only show output on failure. Run only tests related to changed files, not the full suite. Most test runners support file-pattern filtering.

## Retry Caps

Max 2 CI rounds. No infinite loops.

```
1. Agent implements change
2. Local lint + smoke (deterministic, < 5 seconds)
3. Push to CI — autofix known patterns on failure
4. One more attempt if unfixed
5. After 2nd CI failure → hand back to human
```

A PR that's 80% correct and an engineer polishes in 20 minutes > an agent retrying indefinitely at escalating token cost.
