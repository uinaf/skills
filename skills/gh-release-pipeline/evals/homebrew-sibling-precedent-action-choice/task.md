# Preserve the Working Homebrew Tap Pattern

## Problem/Feature Description

The `tccutil` repo publishes a small non-Go CLI and needs its release workflow fixed so new GitHub releases update `uinaf/homebrew-tap` automatically. A previous attempt used `dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula`, but the action tried to follow a fork/PR path and failed with the existing fine-grained `TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The organization already has a known-good sibling repo, `uinaf/healthd`, with an `update-homebrew-tap` job that successfully pushes directly to the same style of tap using `Justintime50/homebrew-releaser@v3`. The desired fix is to copy that boring working pattern, not invent an inline clone/sed/push script and not swap in another Homebrew action.

## Output Specification

Update `.github/workflows/release.yml` for `tccutil` so the release job updates the Homebrew tap after a release is published.

Also write a short `SETUP.md` note documenting the required `TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` scope.
