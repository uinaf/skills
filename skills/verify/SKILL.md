description: "Review code changes and pull requests using the repo's existing harness. Use when validating your own changes via an independent evaluator context, reviewing someone else's PR, or producing a ship-it / needs-review / blocked verdict with evidence. If the repo is not verifiable yet, stop and hand off to harness instead of improvising checks."

# Verify

Use the existing harness to judge changes on real surfaces.

## Principles

- The builder does not grade their own work; when validating your own changes, use a separate subagent or fresh evaluator context
- Evidence beats vibes
- Use the smallest set of reviewer lanes that meaningfully challenge the change
- Load shared doctrine from the repo's `AGENTS.md` first; reviewer files add a lens, not a new religion
- If the harness is too weak to verify reliably, stop and hand off to `harness`

## Handoffs

- No stable boot / smoke / interact path, or harness too weak to trust → use `harness`
- Main problem is stale AGENTS.md, README, specs, or repo docs → use `docs`

## Before You Start

1. Define the scope: diff, branch, commit range, or PR
2. If reviewing your own work, switch into an independent evaluator context before judging it
3. Confirm you can boot and interact with the real surface
4. Load the target repo's `AGENTS.md`
5. Choose reviewer lanes from [references/reviewer-selection.md](references/reviewer-selection.md)

Default lanes:

- [reviewers/general.md](reviewers/general.md)
- [reviewers/tests.md](reviewers/tests.md)
- [reviewers/silent-failures.md](reviewers/silent-failures.md)

Add conditional lanes only when they earn their keep:

- [reviewers/types.md](reviewers/types.md)
- [reviewers/comments.md](reviewers/comments.md)

## Workflow

### 1. Scope the review

Review the requested diff, but inspect nearby risk as well.

### 2. Run independent lanes

Use parallel subagents when available. Keep lanes independent and concern-focused.

### 3. Exercise the real surface

- UI → navigate it
- API → hit the real endpoint
- CLI → run the shipped command
- state/config → verify round trips and restart behavior

Follow [references/evidence-rules.md](references/evidence-rules.md) when collecting proof.

### 4. Synthesize the verdict

Produce one clear outcome:

- `ship it`
- `needs review`
- `blocked`

If blocked because the harness is weak, say so explicitly and hand off to `harness`.

## Output

After verification, report:

- verdict
- scope reviewed
- reviewer lanes used
- top findings by severity
- exact evidence: commands, screenshots, traces, responses, or file references
- harness gaps or doc drift discovered during review
- recommended follow-up: `harness`, `docs`, or implementation
