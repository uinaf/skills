# skills

Shared agent skill library. Bias toward harness engineering: small AGENTS files, repo-first truth, and command-backed verification.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **docs** | Project docs that keep a repo legible to agents. AGENTS as TOC, deeper guidance in versioned docs, command-backed audits. |
| **verify** | Post-implementation reality check. Run after tests pass, before declaring done, using the harness as source of truth and recording proof. |

## Install

```bash
npx skills add uinaf/skills -g -s docs
