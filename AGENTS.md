# AGENTS.md

Instructions for contributors in this repo.

- Treat `AGENTS.md` as a table of contents, not a manual. Put details in `references/`.
- Use progressive disclosure. Keep core workflow in `SKILL.md`; move deeper detail to `references/` when it earns its keep.
- Keep `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` concise. Put task-specific detail in `docs/*`.
- Do not duplicate guidance across skills.
- Every skill must have frontmatter `name` and `description` only.
- Prefer iterative versions (`v0`, `v1`, ...) over giant first drafts.
- Keep examples practical and review-oriented.
- Keep the repo as the system of record. If guidance matters, write it into versioned files.
- Prefer mechanical enforcement over prose when a rule can be checked by scripts, templates, or CI.
- Prefer harness evidence over intuition. Inspect files, run commands, and tune wording from what the repo actually does.
